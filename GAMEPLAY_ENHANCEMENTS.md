# CODE BLUE: Gameplay Enhancement Ideas

## Inspired by "The Pitt" Episodes 101-102

---

## 1. Persistent Background Cases

### "The Boarders"

Several patients persist across multiple shifts, becoming familiar faces:

| Boarder | Condition | Personality | Teaching Value |
|---------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Myrna** | Behavioral health hold | Inappropriate, unpredictable | Managing difficult patients, setting boundaries |
| **Earl** | Homeless, frequent visitor | Always wants a sandwich | Compassion fatigue, resource limitations |
| **"The Kraken"** | Psych hold, violent when awake | Sedated most of the time | De-escalation, chemical restraint decisions |
| **Louie** | Chronic alcoholic | Friendly, predictable | Alcohol withdrawal management |

**Mechanic**: Each shift, 1-3 boarders are present. You may be asked to check on them, handle an escalation, or simply witness their ongoing presence as a reminder of systemic failures.

---

## 2. Anniversary & Trauma Days

### "Heavy Days"

Certain shifts are marked as emotionally significant:

- **Anniversary of Dr. Adamson's death**: Staff more emotional, attending references pandemic losses
- **Holiday shifts**: Loneliness, family conflicts, increased overdoses
- **Full moon nights**: Urban legend or reality? Chaos either way

**Mechanic**: On these days, internal skill checks (COMPOSURE, HUMANITY) have modified DCs. Relationship opportunities are heightened. Flashback scenes may trigger.

---

## 3. The Hallway Death

### "Mr. Milton"

A patient in the hallway, waiting on labs, dies unnoticed.

This is a **critical teaching moment** about:
- Patient placement and monitoring
- The dangers of "low acuity" assumptions
- The psychological weight of preventable deaths

**Possible Implementation**:
- If you don't check on routine patients periodically, one may deteriorate
- A background timer runs for certain "stable" patients
- Missing the check = discovering a code in progress or worse

---

## 4. Staff Dynamics: Running Jokes & Conflicts

### Character Interactions

| Interaction | Type | Example |
|-------------|------|---------|
| **Langdon vs. Garcia** | Competitive banter | "Crikes' sake" / "ER Ken" |
| **Dana's Wisdom** | Mentorship | "Just walk away. Best possible scenario." |
| **Mateo's WMMV Scale** | Dark humor | "What Makes Mateo Vomit" |
| **Perlah's Patience** | Consistent kindness | Always gives Earl another sandwich |

**Mechanic**: Witness or participate in these interactions to build relationship XP. Some are skill checks (COMMUNICATION to land a good joke, HIERARCHY to know when to stay silent).

---

## 5. Impossible Saves

### "When It Doesn't Matter"

Some codes cannot be won:

- **DNR arrives mid-code**: Stop everything. Document. Move on.
- **Downtime too long**: Continue for family's sake, know it won't work.
- **Biologically incompatible with life**: Heroic efforts are futile.

**Mechanic**: Not every resuscitation succeeds. The game should include codes that teach you to recognize futility without making you feel like you failed. 

**Teaching Beat**: 
> "You can't shock asystole."
> "Three rounds of epi and then call it."

---

## 6. End-of-Life Decision Conflicts

### "The Spencer Problem"

**Scenario**: Patient has DNI/DNR. Family has durable power of attorney. Family wants full intervention anyway.

**The Conflict**:
- Medical ethics say honor patient's wishes
- Legal reality says DPOA can override
- Time pressure means ethics committee isn't an option

**Player Choices**:
- Advocate strongly for patient's wishes (ADVOCACY check)
- Comply with family's demands reluctantly
- Try to delay/stall for ethics consult
- Escalate to attending/CMO

**Outcome**: There's no perfect answer. The game teaches moral distress.

---

## 7. Pediatric Toxicology + CPS

### "The Gummy Kid"

**Scenario**: 4-year-old ingested father's THC gummies. Medical management is straightforward. The social situation explodes.

**The Chaos**:
- Mother becomes combative when CPS is mentioned
- Father is apologetic, scared
- Parents turn on each other
- Security is called
- Child is caught in the middle

**Player Role**:
- De-escalation (COMMUNICATION DC 12)
- Protecting the child's care despite chaos
- Working with social work and CPS
- Not taking sides

**Teaching Points**:
- Mandatory reporting laws
- Maintaining clinical focus during social crisis
- The different outcomes for different families (systemic bias)

---

## 8. The "Homeboy Ambulance"

### Dropped at the Door

**Scenario**: A patient with GSW is literally dumped at the ambulance bay by unknown individuals who flee.

**Gameplay**:
- No prehospital info
- No history
- Unknown allergies
- Must move fast

**Teaching Points**:
- Trauma resuscitation without history
- Calling OR for emergent surgery
- ICE contacts on phones
- Documentation challenges

---

## 9. Comic Relief Cases

### "The Shock Collar"

**Scenario**: Man arrives with dog shock collar Krazy Glued to his neck by vengeful girlfriend.

**Treatment Options**:
- Solvent application
- Battery removal (glued shut)
- Wait for skin to slough (2 weeks)

**Purpose**: Not every case is life-or-death. Some are absurd. Dark humor is medicine's coping mechanism.

---

## 10. The Cop Moment

### "Absolutely Not"

**Scenario**: A cop investigating a case lingers, seems interested in a staff member.

**Staff Response**: 
> "There is no possible scenario in which you and I have this conversation."

**Teaching Point**: Professional boundaries. Personal life stays personal. Also: a moment of levity and character development.

---

## 11. Wandering Dementia Patient

### "Beto"

**Scenario**: A retired janitor with dementia wanders into the ED, thinking he still works there.

**Staff Response**: They let him "work." His family picks him up later. It gives them a break, and he's happy.

**Teaching Points**:
- Dementia awareness
- Family caregiver burden
- The ER as community space
- Humanity over efficiency

---

## 12. Structural Critiques

### "The Rats"

**Scenario**: Actual rats appear in the ED (from an unhoused patient's clothing layers).

**Gloria's Response**: "Do you know how bad this looks? One more reason to shutter this place."

**Robby's Response**: Dark humor. "They should be dead within the hour—they're headed to the cafeteria."

**Mechanic**: These moments reinforce the decaying infrastructure of public hospitals. They're not puzzles to solve—they're atmosphere.

---

## 13. Concurrent Emergencies

### "The Board is Full"

**Scenario**: Multiple critical patients arrive simultaneously. You must triage who gets attention.

**Example from Script**:
- Nick Bradley (fentanyl OD, brainstem death)
- Mr. Spencer (sepsis, BiPAP, DNI conflict)  
- Theresa/David (indirect presentation, flight risk)
- GSW (emergent OR)
- Electrocution (fasciotomy)
- Mr. Milton (hallway, dying unnoticed)

**Mechanic**: The player cannot be everywhere. Choices have consequences. Some patients will deteriorate while you're with others.

---

## 14. The Unanswered Call

### "He's Not Picking Up"

**Scenario** (David case): Despite your best efforts, the person who needs help refuses contact.

**Mechanic**: Some storylines don't resolve. The game should allow for cases that end with uncertainty.

**Narrative Tool**: Potential follow-up in later shifts (news report, return visit, or nothing at all).

---

## 15. Skill-Based Trauma Procedures

### Learnable Procedures from Episodes

| Procedure | Who Performs | Teaching Context |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| **Cricothyrotomy** | Mel (R-2) | First time on living patient |
| **Fasciotomy** | Collins (Senior Resident) | Attending guides her hand |
| **Trigger point injection** | Shah (Intern) | Did it before presenting—wrong order |
| **Rapid Rhino** | ED staff | Nosebleed control |
| **Le Fort III stabilization** | Surgery | Facial fracture management |

**Mechanic**: Each procedure has a progression:
1. Observe
2. Assist
3. Perform (supervised)
4. Perform (solo)

---

## 16. The M&M Debrief

### "What Went Well?"

After a patient death, staff gathers for a **Morbidity & Mortality debrief** led by social worker Kiara.

**Structure**:
1. What went well?
2. What could have gone differently?
3. Personal reflection (optional)
4. Moment of silence

**Player Participation**:
- You may be asked to speak
- Choosing to share earns HUMANITY XP
- Choosing silence is also valid

**Mechanic**: Participating in debriefs reduces the COMPOSURE penalty from patient deaths.

---

## 17. Door-to-Balloon Time

### "Time Is Myocardium"

STEMI cases have a visible timer: **51 minutes** from door to balloon inflation.

**Why It Matters**:
> "Our door to balloon time gets reviewed, critiqued, and published online."

**Gameplay**:
- Timer appears when STEMI arrives
- Every action has a time cost
- Delays compound
- Success = timer stops with time remaining
- Failure = patient outcomes worsen, statistics suffer

**Teaching Point**: Emergency medicine is measured. Accountability is built into the system.

---

## 18. The Speed Lecture

### "Slow-Mo"

**Scene**: Attending lectures resident about working too slowly.

> "You're afraid of making a mistake?"
> "I'm always afraid of making a mistake."
> "You make a mistake once, and somebody dies, and you feel so badly about it, you'll never let it happen again..."
> "How is that wrong?"
> "Because you waste time and money on unnecessary tests. You keep sick patients waiting too long. You miss out on cases you could be learning from."

**Two Philosophies**:
- **Thoroughness**: More tests, more time, fewer errors
- **Efficiency**: Move faster, see more patients, accept risk

**Mechanic**: The game tracks your speed. Too slow = lecture. Too fast = mistakes.

---

## 19. The Scrubs Machine

### "Old Scrubs Go In, New Scrubs Come Out"

A moment of comic relief: the scrubs vending machine.

**Rules**:
- You must return old scrubs before getting new ones
- If you're covered in bodily fluids, you need this
- If you "killed" a patient (they died), your scrubs are symbolically tainted

**Dialogue**:
> "What happened here? Did we have an accident?"
> "Do you think I'm wearing this by choice?"
> "Was it number one or number two?"

---

## 20. The Letter

### "Reading Dr. Abbot's Letter"

**Scene**: A veteran dies in the ED. His sister arrives. She cannot read the letter left by the attending (Dr. Abbot). She asks you to read it aloud.

**The Request**:
> "Would it be too much to ask you to read it to me?"

**Player Choice**:
- Read the letter (emotional, builds connection)
- Decline politely (protects yourself, valid boundary)

**If You Read**:
> "To the family of Raymond Orser, my name is Dr. Jack Abbot. I am the emergency department physician who treated Raymond. I, like Ray, am also a veteran. And though I never met Raymond before today, I served with men like him..."

**Effect**: +HUMANITY, +COMPOSURE (finding meaning in death)

---

## 21. Grief Collisions

### "Did You Give My Son Drugs?"

**Scene**: A grieving parent encounters another patient in a connected case.

**Example**: Nick's father sees Jenna (who survived her OD) and attacks her.

**Player Options**:
- Attempt to intervene (COMPOSURE DC 12)
- Call security (correct, but feels passive)
- Let staff handle it (learn from observation)

**Teaching Point**: You cannot control grief. You can only manage the environment.

---

## 22. Pregnancy Reveal

### "When Are You Due?"

**Scene**: A patient notices the player character is pregnant before anyone else does.

> "You can always tell."

**Mechanic**: This could be used for player character development or for NPCs. Adds personal dimension to clinical encounters.

---

## 23. "Face Your Fears"

### Dana's Teaching Method

**Scene**: Student tries to cherry-pick easy cases. Dana intervenes.

> "What up there scares you the most?"
> "All of it."
> "Pick the worst."
> "Back pain. That could be leaking AAA, cauda equina, spinal epidural abscess."
> "Not today. We're gonna work this lady up like a race car."

**Mechanic**: When you try to avoid cases, Dana may force you to take the hardest one.

---

## 24. "Cherry Picking" Detection

Staff notices if you're selecting easy cases.

> "Don't make me tell Robby you're cherry picking."

**Consequence**: Reduced skill growth, attending disappointment, potential lecture.

---

## 25. The Ho'oponopono

### "The Four Things That Matter Most"

A Hawaiian ritual for saying goodbye. Dr. Robby teaches families four simple statements:

1. **I love you.**
2. **Thank you.**
3. **I forgive you.**
4. **Please forgive me.**

**When to Offer**:
- Family is present at a death
- They seem lost, don't know what to say
- EMPATHY DC 8 to suggest it appropriately

**Player Choice**: Offering this creates a meaningful death scene. Some players may prefer silence.

---

## 26. "I Statements" vs "You Statements"

### Communication Teaching

**Wrong Approach** (Distraction):
> Patient: "A boy I barely knew is dead."
> You: "So... do you play any sports?"

**Wrong Approach** ("You" statement):
> "You need to move on."

**Right Approach** ("I" statement):
> "I can see how painful this is."

**Teaching Point**: "I" statements acknowledge reality and invite further conversation. "You" statements create distance.

**Mechanic**: Dialogue options marked with (I-STATEMENT) have higher success rates with distressed patients.

---

## 27. "We Bring Education, Not Baggage"

### The Trinity Confrontation

**Scene**: A nursing student (Trinity) tries to use personal experience to connect with a patient. McKay shuts it down.

> "Your personal experience isn't germane here."
> "Are you aware you have an aggressive energy, Trinity?"
> "We bring our education to the job, not our baggage."

**Teaching Point**: There's a line between empathy and projection. Knowing where you end and the patient begins is essential.

**Mechanic**: If player leans too heavily on personal history, mentor may intervene.

---

## 28. Yellow Wings

### Psych Takedown Milestone

**Requirement**: Participate in your first team restraint/sedation of an agitated psych patient.

**The Scene**:
- 5-6 staff members
- Each person has an assigned limb or role
- Coordinated entry, synchronized restraint
- IM injection (midazolam + Haldol)
- Monitor for 20 minutes

**Reward**: 
- "Yellow Wings" achievement
- Permanent +1 to TEAMWORK with nursing staff
- You're part of the team now

---

## 29. "She Split"

### Patients Who Leave

**Scenario**: Sherry Davis, the "Sterno mom" with a hand burn, leaves before wound care.

> "She split."
> "When?"
> "I gave the kids two breakfasts each off the boarders' cart, and they left."

**The Reality**: She probably had to get to work. Or get the kids to school. Or couldn't afford to wait. Or was afraid of CPS.

**Mechanic**: Some patients leave AMA (against medical advice) or simply disappear. You cannot save everyone, especially when systemic barriers exist.

**Teaching Point**: This is healthcare access in America.

---

## 30. The Ambulance Chase

### Staff Gambling

**Background**: Someone stole the ambulance from the bay. Police are in pursuit. Staff is watching on the news and placing bets.

**Betting Categories**:
- Where will it end up? (Swissvale, Canada, caught in zone)
- Who stole it? (Junkies, meth heads, psych patient, pro chop shop)
- Outcome? (Crash, caught, escape)

**Dana's Response**:
> "I'm breaking up this sewing circle."

**Mechanic**: Moments of levity during chaos. The gambling isn't serious — it's coping.

---

## 31. "Physician, Heal Thyself"

### Self-Care Reminders

**Scene**: Dana notices Robby's third cup of coffee before 11 AM.

> "Everything okay with you?"
> "I'm not sleeping great. It's f*cking with me a little bit."
> "I've got four days off next week. I think I'm gonna get out of Dodge."

**The Quote**:
> "What'd Shakespeare say — 'Physician, heal thyself'?"
> "Not Shakespeare. Luke, the disciple."

**Mechanic**: The game tracks player stress. Mentors may comment if you're running too hard. Taking breaks (time skips, personal scenes) restores COMPOSURE.

---

## 32. Waiting Room Collapse

### The Cliffhanger Mechanic

**Scene**: At the end of a busy stretch, someone collapses in the waiting room.

> "Hey, I need a gurney in here! Now!"

**Mechanic**: Just when you think the shift is calming down, something new arrives. The ED is never truly "caught up."

---

## 33. Medication Abortion

### Sensitive Topic Handling

**Scenario**: Kristi Wheeler, 17, returns for a medication abortion after missing her earlier appointment.

**Key Elements**:
- Dr. Abbot saw her initially; Dr. Collins takes over
- Confirm gestational age via ultrasound
- Standard medical questions (allergies, surgeries, last menstrual period)
- No judgment, just care

**Mechanic**: These cases exist. The game can include them without editorializing. The player provides compassionate, competent care.

---

## 34. Jenna's Redemption Arc

### The Apology

**Scene**: Jenna (the OD survivor) sees Nick's father in the hallway. Instead of avoiding him, she approaches.

> "I just wanted to apologize for the way I spoke to you."
> "Nick was just being nice when he said he'd do it [pick up the Xanax]."
> "I am so sorry. I really hope he pulls through this."

**Father's Response**: Softens. Accepts the apology. Tells her to go home.

**Teaching Point**: Redemption is possible. Apologizing takes courage. Sometimes it helps.

**Mechanic**: If a patient causes conflict earlier, they may have a chance to repair it later.

---

## 35. Fentanyl Test Strips & Narcan Discharge

### Harm Reduction

**Scene**: Jenna is discharged with:
- Fentanyl test strips ("These work on pills and liquids")
- Narcan spray ("Keep it in your purse just in case")

> "You realize how lucky you are?"

**Mechanic**: When discharging OD survivors, offering harm reduction supplies is an option. It may reduce future deaths.

---

## 36. Impact Over Intent

### "You Didn't Ask What She Needed"

**The Lesson**: Good intentions don't excuse bad outcomes.

**Wrong Approach**:
- Assume you know what patient needs
- Call in social services without consent
- Project your own experiences onto them

**Right Approach**:
- Ask what they need
- Build trust first
- Offer resources, let them choose

**McKay's Words**:
> "You gotta slow down, take a beat, and listen instead of judging people."
> "Listening and building trust will make us better doctors... and better people."

---

## 37. Staff Backstories

### "Not Everybody Has It Figured Out"

**McKay reveals her history to a struggling patient**:
- Former addict
- Lost custody of her son Harrison
- "Very dark times"
- Sober 9 years, 2 months, 14 days
- Wears ankle monitor (legal issue, resolved soon)
- Joint custody returning next week

**Teaching Point**: Doctors are human. They have their own struggles. Vulnerability can build connection, but must be used carefully.

**Mechanic**: Certain NPCs will reveal backstories as relationship deepens. This builds connection but can also be TMI in wrong contexts.

---

## 38. Robby & Jake

### Personal Relationships in the ED

**Scene**: Jake (Robby's 17-year-old son) visits the ED to pick up concert passes. He ditched Robby to go with his new girlfriend Leah instead.

**Staff Interactions**:
- Dana gives relationship advice
- Mateo shares embarrassing stories
- Robby gives fatherly warnings about fentanyl

**Mechanic**: Personal life intersects with work. These moments humanize the staff and provide breathing room between crises.

---

## 39. "Pick Your Battles"

### When to Go Over Your Senior's Head

**Donahue's Advice to Santos**:
> "Hypothetically, I wouldn't recommend going over a resident unless it's a behavioral issue or harassment."
> "If it's patient care related... if it's something minor, leave it alone. If it endangers the patient, definitely yes."
> "Pick your battles. You don't want to be the intern who cried wolf."

**Application**:
- Lorazepam vial issue → Report to attending
- Disagreement on medication dosing → Let senior decide
- Suspected record falsification → Complex, depends on stakes

---

## 40. The Adamson Legacy

### Mentors Live On

**Scene**: Retrograde intubation saves Travis.

> "Retrograde intubation, that's an Adamson special. I learned that from the best."

**Dr. Adamson**:
- Robby's mentor
- Died during COVID (anniversary in Episode 101)
- His techniques continue to save lives

**Mechanic**: Flashback scenes or skill unlocks tied to learning techniques from lost mentors. The dead still teach.

---

## 41. Ambulance Chase Resolution

### The Payoff

After running through multiple episodes, the stolen ambulance chase ends:

> "Looks like the driver lost control as the police cars were closing in."
> "That's in our zone."
> "Ambulance crashed in our catchment. Get ready for incoming."

**Mechanic**: Background events (like the ambulance chase) can suddenly become your problem. What seemed like entertainment becomes work.

---

## 42. Sherry Returns (and Leaves Again)

### Some Patients Keep Coming Back

**Setup**: Sherry (Sterno mom, burn on hand) left before wound care in Episode 104.

**Episode 105**: She returns. McKay treats her. Connects with her. Then Whitaker oversteps, and she leaves again.

> "I doubt she'll be back. But sadly, there will be many, many more just like her."

**Mechanic**: Recurring patients who cycle in and out. Your choices affect whether they return or disappear permanently.

---

## 43. "Morgue Scrubs"

### The Shame Uniform

**Scene**: Whitaker, covered in blood again, goes to the scrubs machine. Only morgue scrubs (dark, unflattering) are left in his size.

> "Poor Huckleberry. Not even 11:30 and you've already been demoted."
> "Then I guess you better not f*ck anything else up today, huh?"

**Mechanic**: Visual indicator of having a rough day. Staff notices. Comments ensue.

---

## 44. The Corporate Threat

### ECQ America

**Scene**: Hospital administrator Gloria introduces Dr. Tracy Morris from ECQ America, a contract management company interested in taking over the ED.

**The Stakes**:
- ECQ runs 500+ ERs nationwide
- Metrics look good on dashboards
- Staff pay gets cut
- Robby offered bribe: "Regional Medical Director" role

**Gloria's Ultimatum**:
> "Improve scores with the resources we have, or we will explore what ECQ has to offer."

**Mechanic**: Periodic administration pressure events. Meet metrics or face consequences (staff cuts, management changes, loss of autonomy).

---

## 45. ADF: Always Discharge First

### Throughput Pressure

**The Rule**: Before picking up a new patient, discharge anyone who's ready to go.

**Robby's Lecture**:
> "If there's a discharge to be done, do it before you pick up a new patient."
> "Don't keep them here any longer than they need to be."

**The Reality**: Players are incentivized to clear beds quickly. But rushing discharges can lead to missed diagnoses.

**Mechanic**: "ADF" reminders appear when you try to see a new patient with pending discharges.

---

## 46. Show Your Work

### MDM Documentation

**The Push**: Document not just the diagnosis, but all the critical conditions you ruled out.

> "Make sure your decision-making reflects not just the diagnosis but all the thought you put into ruling out critical illnesses."

**Staff Pushback**:
> "More work? I do enough charting as it is."

**Langdon's Cynicism**:
> "It's less about charting and more about profit."

**Mechanic**: Charts can be audited. Incomplete documentation = billing issues and potential liability.

---

## 47. Mel's Sister

### Staff Personal Lives

**Reveal**: Mel (Jesse King) calls her sister Becca during a break. Becca is in a care facility.

> "Are you coming to get me?"
> "Remember, I'm coming to pick you up after my shift."
> "Have you found a boyfriend yet?"

**Context**: Mel was previously identified as her sister's primary caregiver. Sister is now in a facility in North Hills.

**Mechanic**: Staff have lives outside the hospital. These moments humanize NPCs and create emotional investment.

---

## 48. The Adamson Memorial

### Primanti's Sandwiches

**Scene**: Free Primanti's sandwiches arrive in the staff lounge. Card reveals they're from Shelby Adamson — Dr. Adamson's sister.

> "She sends something every year."

**Robby's Reaction**: Quiet. Distant. Doesn't engage with the food.

**Context**: Dr. Adamson was Robby's mentor. Died during COVID. Anniversary just passed.

**Mechanic**: Annual memorial events that affect staff mood. Some bring comfort. Some reopen wounds.

---

## 49. Intern Bad Day Tracking

### "At Least I Didn't Kill Anyone"

**Scene**: Santos and Whitaker commiserate in the lounge.

**Whitaker**: Killed a patient (Mr. Bennett), caught an arterial bleeder, wearing morgue scrubs
**Santos**: Stabbed Dr. Garcia with a scalpel during a chest tube

> "I'm not the only f*ck-up here."
> "I got nosebleed." [New patient]
> "So long, fellow losers."

**Mechanic**: The game tracks your bad day. Multiple fumbles compound stress. Dark humor between interns provides relief.

---

## 50. Gynecomastia Discovery

### Incidental Findings

**Scene**: During Silas Dunn's chest tube, Santos notices bilateral breast enlargement.

**Robby prompts**: "What's in the differential diagnosis for male gynecomastia?"

**Answer**: Alcoholism, pituitary tumors, gonadal pathology

**Follow-up orders**: LFTs, hormonal levels (estrogen, testosterone, prolactin, hCG, progesterone)

**Mechanic**: Sometimes you find things you weren't looking for. Incidental findings require workup.

---

## 51. "Too Young to Make That Decision"

### Organ Donation Resistance

**Scene**: Nick Bradley's parents are told about his documented organ donor status.

**Mother's Refusal**:
> "He was too young to make that kind of decision."
> "He is still my son!"

**The Law**: At 18, his wishes are legally binding.

**The Reality**: Families often resist. Pushing too hard damages trust.

**Emma's Approach**: "They need more time."

**Mechanic**: Organ donation conversations require EMPATHY checks. Pushing equals backlash. Patience may yield consent.

---

## 52. Family Support Specialists

### Emma Isaacs

A non-physician who specializes in helping families navigate death, grief, and decisions.

**Her Role**:
- Lead organ donation conversations
- Coordinate with funeral directors
- Answer "what happens now" questions
- Stay with families through the process

**Teaching Point**: Physicians aren't always the best at these conversations. Specialists exist for a reason.

---

## 53. The Bathroom Standoff

### Kristi Wheeler Escalation

**Scene**: Kristi locks herself in the bathroom. Her mother refuses consent. Her aunt argues for her rights.

> "I want the pills!"
> "You are treating Kristi like Mom treated you."
> "She is my daughter!"

**The Standoff**: No resolution in this episode. Chaos continues.

**Mechanic**: Some cases don't resolve cleanly. The player may have to step away and let events unfold.

---

## 54. ECMO Activation

### Last Resort Cardiac Support

**Criteria for ECMO**:
- CPR within 5 minutes of arrest
- Initial rhythm V-fib, V-tach, or PEA
- Failed standard resuscitation attempts

**The Process**:
1. Cordis introducer in femoral vessels
2. Large catheters placed in vein and artery
3. Connect to ECMO circuit (sterile technique critical)
4. Machine takes over heart and lung function
5. Wait for coronary artery to be opened

**The Weight**:
> "A 12-year-old needs this. He's been on the ECMO for 17 days."

**Mechanic**: ECMO is a resource allocation decision. Someone else may be waiting.

---

## 55. "We F*cking Wait"

### The Hardest Part

**Scene**: Harvey Chang is on ECMO. Everything that can be done has been done.

> "What do you want to do?"
> "We wait. We f*cking wait."

**Mechanic**: Some outcomes are out of your hands. The game forces you to wait, to sit with uncertainty.

---

## 56. Robby vs Langdon

### The Big Fight

**Trigger**: Langdon signed off on Mohan's heavy metal panel. Robby is furious that Collins backed Mohan over his decision.

**Langdon's Feedback**:
> "You've been snapping at staff all day."
> "You can't even be honest with yourself."
> "Leave your baggage at the door like everyone else."

**Robby's Response**:
> "You are a rule follower in an environment that requires flexibility."
> "You let fear drive your decision making."
> "You have no f*cking respect for your superiors."
> "I'm your attending. You need to remember that."

**Mechanic**: Relationship damage between staff affects department dynamics. Major conflicts can't be undone easily.

---

## 57. Robby's Breakdown

### The Supply Closet

**Episode 107 ends with Robby alone**:

Shaking. Sobbing. Banging on walls.

**No witnesses. No dialogue. Just collapse.**

**Context**: Adamson anniversary, two deaths today, ECMO uncertainty, fight with Langdon, Gloria's pressure, Nick Bradley's family still undecided.

**Mechanic**: Even the leader can break. Staff mental health is finite. The game should show consequences of sustained pressure.

---

## 58. Autistic Patient Accommodations

### Mel's Approach with Terrence

**Adjustments**:
1. Dim the lights
2. Reduce noise (turn off beeping monitors)
3. Ask open-ended questions about patient's concerns
4. Let patient lead conversation where possible
5. Use visual aids (diagrams, images)

**Langdon's Mistake**: Tried to rush through, got frustrated, gave up.

**Mel's Success**: Took time, adjusted environment, listened.

**Mechanic**: Certain patients require modified approach. Failing to recognize this = failed encounter.

---

## 59. "Listen to Your Patient"

### Collins's Teaching

**To Mohan, about Nandi**:
> "She keeps saying something's wrong. It doesn't feel right to me."

**Collins**: "Listen to your patient. That is your superpower."

**Result**: Mohan digs deeper, finds mercury poisoning.

**Mechanic**: When patients insist, the game rewards investigation. Dismissing them = missed diagnoses.

---

## 60. Moral Gray Zones

### Santos Threatens Silas

**The Setup**: Wife suspects husband is molesting daughter. Can't prove it. Mandated reporting doesn't apply without evidence.

**Santos's Choice**: Threatens the intubated patient directly.

> "Blink twice if you agree to this, once if you want me to let you die."

**The Ethics**:
- Is this appropriate? No.
- Is it effective? Maybe.
- Does it cross lines? Absolutely.
- Would most players do it? Yes.

- Online job ad
- Small town origin

**Separation Strategy**: Fake CT scan (radiation = companion can't come).

**Private Interview Questions**:
- "Do you have any concerns about your job or your boss?"
- "Sometimes people are pressured to have sex when they don't want to."

**Mechanic**: Trafficking screening is part of certain patient encounters. Miss the signs = missed opportunity.

---

### When to Report a Colleague

**Santos's Observations**:
- Lorazepam vial couldn't open (episode 105)
- Same vial returned "unused" to PDS
- Librium missing from patient's prescription

**Santos to Dana**:
> "I'm concerned he could be stealing."

**Dana's Response**:
> "He's a great doctor. I've never seen him impaired. You've been here for seven hours. Just do your job."

**The Dilemma**:
- Act too early = "crying wolf," damage relationships
- Act too late = enable harm, complicity

**Mechanic**: Player accumulates observation points about staff. Reporting requires evidence.

---

## 68. Terminal Lab Values

### Knowing When It's Over

**Amber's potassium**: 14.2

> "No one has ever survived a cardiac arrest with a potassium over 11."

> "Day one of residency at Big Charity in New Orleans. Five-year-old boy, accidentally shot by his brother playing with Dad's g*n. That night, I asked myself: Where do I put this feeling? And I found myself at the gates of Big Charity Cemetery. And I'm thinking: That's what I need. A safe place where I can put these feelings."

**Mechanic**: Staff develop coping mechanisms. Some are healthy. Some are burial.

---

## 72. Langdon Gets Shut Down

### Public Correction

**Langdon berates Santos** for not calling him during a seizure:

> "Is it hubris or ignorance that makes you think you know more than residents with two to three years more experience?"
> "Your job is to shut up, listen, and learn."

**Robby intervenes in front of everyone**:

> "Knock it off. Shut the f*ck up!"
> "Where does it say that shaming, belittling, and insulting are effective teaching tools?"
> "Harassment has zero educational value."
> "This kind of behavior will not be tolerated."

**Mechanic**: Toxic teaching gets corrected. Public shaming of residents = consequences.

---

## 73. Collins's Miscarriage

### Working Through Personal Loss

**During debriefing**:

**Outcome**: One needs dental cement, one needs hand surgery.

**Mechanic**: Violence in the waiting room creates multiple new patients and security calls.

---

## 77. Fight Bite Protocol

### Joint Penetration Test

**Robby teaches**:
> "Human mouths are filthy, some more than others."

**Saline Injection Test**:
1. Inject sterile saline into knuckle joint
2. If it sprays out the bite wound = joint violated
3. Needs OR washout and IV antibiotics

**Mechanic**: Fight bites are high-risk injuries. Test for joint penetration.

---

## 78. Javadi's "Human Utah"

### Workplace Crushes

**Javadi to McKay**:

**Robby**: "Apparently. And I just f*cking let him! You're done."

**Mechanic**: Staff suspicion arc concludes. Santos was right. Reporting matters.

---

## 82. The Parkland Formula

### Burn Fluid Resuscitation

**Mechanic**: Burns require massive fluid replacement. Player calculates or fails resuscitation.

---

## 83. Escharotomy

### When the Burn Is Too Tight

**Problem**: Full-thickness burns cause eschar (burnt skin) that can't expand.

**Signs**:
- High peak pressure on vent
- Low tidal volume
- Restrictive breathing pattern

**Procedure**:
1. Vertical incisions from clavicle to lower ribs
2. Horizontal incision connecting them

### "I Can Live With This One"

**Robby**: "I specifically told you to leave Theresa Saunders alone."

**McKay**: "A decision was not made. So I made it."

**Robby**: "It was not yours to make! You may have ruined this kid's life forever."

**McKay's Defense**:
> "What about the girls on this list? Are their lives worth less than his?"
> "I can live with this one. And now you can too."

**Mechanic**: Sometimes interns make better calls than attendings. Standing your ground has value.

---

## 87. Nurse Safety Crisis

### "Three Denied Requests"

**Nurses threaten union involvement**.

**Mechanic**: Systemic failures in hospital security. Administration deflects. Nurses are vulnerable.

---

## 88. Prodigy Parallels

### Javadi and Everett

**McKay notices**: Javadi (college at 13) and Everett (future Cy Young) are both pressure-cooker prodigies.

**Javadi snaps at the dad**:
> "Your son is freaking out because he may never see again. Forget baseball and just be his dad."

**McKay's Lesson**:
> "As physicians, we gotta learn to keep our emotions in check and not let personal experiences interfere with professional responsibilities."

**Mechanic**: Staff personal history affects patient interactions. Awareness matters.

---

## 89. Bedside Epi Drip

### Fast Angioedema Treatment

**Mohan's Solution**: Don't rush to intubate if BP and sats are stable.

**Recipe**:

- Run at 5cc/min

**Result**: Stridor improves without intubation.

> "Slo-Mo, No-Mo!"

**Mechanic**: Epi drip can reverse angioedema faster than preparing for intubation.

---

## 90. "Well Very Taught, Dr. Langdon"

### Ironic Praise Before the Fall

**After escharotomy**, Robby praises Langdon's teaching:
> "Well done. And very well taught, Dr. Langdon."

**Hours later**: Robby fires him for stealing benzos.

**Mechanic**: People can be excellent at their jobs and still have hidden problems. Competence doesn't equal integrity.

---

---

## 91. Dana Quits

### The Breaking Point

**Trigger**: Dana finishes her shift after being punched, but the accumulation of trauma (decades of abuse, lack of security) hits her.
