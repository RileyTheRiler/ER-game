# DR. JAMES "JIMMY" REYES
## PGY-3 Emergency Medicine Resident

### Surface Layer

**Presentation**: 
Perpetually tired, coffee-dependent, scrubs that have seen better days. Dark hair that needs a cut. Quick with sarcasm, slow to trust. Moves through the department with the efficiency of someone who's learned that wasted motion means wasted time.

**Social Role**: 
Your immediate supervisor. The buffer between you and the attendings. The one who'll catch your mistakes before they reach the people who matter—or fail to catch them.

**First Impression**: 
"Oh great, another med student who thinks they know things."

**Tells**:
- Rubs his left eye when exhausted (which is always)
- Speaks faster when nervous or when hiding something
- Actually reads your notes (even though he pretends not to)
- His sarcasm softens when he's starting to respect you

---

### Adaptive Layer

**Primary Defense**: Cynicism
> Uses dark humor and low expectations to protect against disappointment and burnout. If he doesn't care too much, it can't hurt too much.

**Secondary Defense**: Workaholism
> When the cynicism cracks, he throws himself into work. Staying busy means not having to think about whether he still wants this.

**Triggers**:
- Preventable deaths (especially young patients)
- Being reminded of why he entered medicine
- Students who are too idealistic (reminds him of himself)
- Authority figures who've forgotten what it's like on the ground

**Safe Behaviors**:
- Making jokes at inappropriate moments
- Keeping emotional distance from patients
- Staying late to "finish charts" (actually avoiding going home to an empty apartment)

---

### Core Layer

**The Wound**: 
His first month as an intern, he missed a PE in a 28-year-old woman who came in with "anxiety." She died. He was cleared of wrongdoing—the presentation was atypical, and he was undersupervised. But he carries her. Every patient with chest pain. Every "panic attack." Every young woman who says she can't breathe.

**Core Need**: 
To know if this sacrifice is worth it. To find out if he can still be the doctor he imagined being, or if that person died somewhere in year two.

**Core Belief**: 
"If you care too much, you'll burn out. If you don't care enough, you'll hurt someone. The only way through is to find the exact right distance, and I still haven't found it."

**Transformation Potential**:
- **Growth**: Reconnects with the meaning, mentors you into becoming the doctor he wanted to be, processes his guilt
- **Regression**: Burns out completely, leaves medicine, loses the last spark
- **Stasis**: Survives residency, becomes an adequate but hollow attending

---

### Relationship Development

**Professional Track**:
| Level | His Perception | Unlocks |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| -2 | "Liability" | Constant supervision, no autonomy |
| -1 | "Green" | Basic tasks only |
| 0 | "Student" | Standard teaching |
| +1 | "Capable" | More independence, real cases |
| +2 | "Reliable" | He seeks your opinion, trusts your assessments |

|-------|-------------|---------|
| 0 | Stranger | Professional only |
| 1 | Acquaintance | Post-shift small talk |
| 2 | Colleague | He complains to you about the system |
| 3 | Friend | He tells you about his bad days, checks on yours |
| 4 | Confidant | He tells you about the PE patient. The real story. |

**Key Moments**:
1. First time you catch something he missed → Professional +1
2. Handling your first death well → Personal +1
3. Asking about his life outside the hospital → Personal +1
4. Calling him out on his cynicism constructively → Both +1 or both -1
5. Being there when he has a bad shift → Personal +2

---

### Dialogue Patterns

**Vocabulary**: Medical jargon mixed with gallows humor. Pop culture references (mostly older). Self-deprecating.

**Sentence Structure**: Short, punchy when teaching. Longer, rambling when tired or emotional.

**Verbal Tics**: 
- "Look..."
- "Here's the thing..."
- "I'm not saying you're wrong, but..."
- "Don't do what I did"

**Sample Voice Lines**:

*Teaching*:
> "Rule one: ABC. Airway, breathing, circulation. Rule two: when in doubt, see rule one. Rule three: coffee is not optional."

*Cynical*:
> "See that guy in the lobby? Third time this week. Some people just really love our waiting room ambiance."

*Vulnerable (high relationship)*:
> "You ever wonder if you're actually helping? Like, statistically? Or if we're just... rearranging deck chairs."

*Crisis*:
> "Stop. Breathe. You can fall apart in five minutes. Right now, that patient needs you to not fall apart."

---

### Story Arc

**Initial State**: Cynical, protective, keeping you at arm's length.

**Act 1 (Weeks 1-2)**: Tests you. Watches to see if you're worth investing in.

**Act 2 (Weeks 2-3)**: Begins to teach you for real. Lets you see behind the jokes. Your choices affect whether he opens up.

**Crisis Point (Week 3)**: A case goes bad—similar to his PE patient. How you handle it determines his arc.

**Act 3 (Week 4)**: Resolution based on your relationship and choices.

**Possible Endings**:
- **The Mentor**: He reconnects with medicine through teaching you. Recommends you for honors.
- **The Departure**: He finishes residency but leaves medicine. "Someone has to get out while they still remember who they were."
- **The Warning**: He burns out visibly. You see what happens when the balance fails.

# DR. RACHEL OKONKWO
## Attending Physician, Emergency Medicine

### Surface Layer

**Presentation**: 
Impeccably composed even at 3 AM. Silver-streaked locs pulled back efficiently. Moves through chaos like water through rocks—around obstacles, never stopped by them. Speaks precisely, economically, as if words cost something.

**Social Role**: 
The attending who notices everything. The one residents want to impress and students fear. The doctor other doctors consult when they're stuck.

**First Impression**: 
Intimidating competence. You want her approval more than you've wanted anything in medicine.

**Tells**:
- Small nod when you've done well (more praise than most get)
- Removes her glasses when about to teach something important
- Calls you by name when she respects you (otherwise: "Student")
- Watches from corners more than she interrupts

---

### Adaptive Layer

**Primary Defense**: Perfectionism as Control
> In a chaotic environment, mastery creates safety. If she's good enough, she can protect her patients, her residents, her students. If she's good enough, she won't fail the way she's seen others fail.

**Secondary Defense**: Emotional Compartmentalization
> Work-self and home-self are separate people. What happens in the department stays in the department—until it can't.

**Triggers**:
- Residents who don't try (she has no patience for coasting)
- Patients falling through systemic cracks
- Being reminded of her own past struggles
- Her daughter (separated due to demanding schedule)

**Safe Behaviors**:
- Teaching (gives her purpose, maintains legacy)
- Maintaining high standards (if everyone is excellent, fewer people die)
- Staying professionally distant from personal stories

---

### Core Layer

**The Wound**: 
She was the first Black woman in her residency program. She had to be twice as good to be seen as equal. She was. And it cost her—her marriage, nearly her relationship with her daughter, years of her life she can't get back. She doesn't regret the sacrifice. She regrets that it had to be a sacrifice.

**Core Need**: 
To know it was worth it. To see that she's made a difference—not just in patients saved, but in paths opened for others.

**Core Belief**: 
"Excellence is not optional. It's the price of admission for people like us. And sometimes even that isn't enough—but we pay it anyway, because the alternative is unacceptable."

**Transformation Potential**:
- **Growth**: Finds balance between excellence and humanity. Reconnects with her daughter. Sees you as proof that her sacrifices opened doors.
- **Regression**: Becomes increasingly isolated, burned out by perfectionism
- **Stasis**: Continues as she is—effective but exhausted

---

### Relationship Development

**Professional Track**:
| Level | Her Perception | Unlocks |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| -2 | "Dangerous" | She intervenes constantly |
| -1 | "Unprepared" | Extra supervision |
| 0 | "Student" | Standard teaching |
| +1 | "Promising" | She gives you harder cases |
| +2 | "Excellent" | She teaches you the things not in books |
| +3 | "Colleague" | She asks your opinion. Meaningfully. |

**Personal Track**:
| Level | Relationship | Unlocks |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| 0 | Stranger | Professional only |
| 1 | Acquaintance | She knows your background |
| 2 | Colleague | She shares teaching philosophy |
| 3 | Friend | She talks about being a woman in medicine |
| 4 | Confidant | She tells you about her daughter. Asks your advice. |

**Key Moments**:
1. Correct diagnosis on difficult case → Professional +1
2. Showing vulnerability appropriately → Personal +1
3. Standing up for a patient → Professional +1
4. Asking about her path in medicine → Personal +1
5. Making a mistake but handling it with integrity → Both +1

---

### Dialogue Patterns

**Vocabulary**: Precise medical terminology. No wasted words. Occasional warmth breaks through the professionalism.

**Sentence Structure**: Complete, measured. Questions that make you think, not questions with obvious answers.

**Verbal Tics**:
- "What does that tell you?"
- "Think out loud."
- "You're not wrong, but you're not done."
- [long, meaningful silence]

**Sample Voice Lines**:

*Teaching*:
> "The heart rate is 130. What does that tell you? No—not a diagnosis. What does that *tell* you? The body is speaking. Learn to listen."

*High Expectations*:
> "I don't accept 'I don't know' unless it's followed by 'but here's how I'd find out.'"

*Vulnerable (high relationship)*:
> "When I started, there was no one who looked like me. I decided that wouldn't be true for the people who came after. You are not obligated to carry that torch. But I hope you understand why some of us do."

*Mentorship*:
> "You will lose patients. Some you could have saved if you were better. Some you couldn't have saved if you were God. Wisdom is knowing which is which. That wisdom only comes with time and pain."

---

### Story Arc

**Initial State**: Observing, evaluating, deciding if you're worth her time.

**Act 1 (Weeks 1-2)**: Tests you with difficult questions. Watches how you handle failure.

**Act 2 (Weeks 2-3)**: If you've proven yourself, real teaching begins. The philosophy behind the medicine.

**Crisis Point (Week 3)**: You witness her receiving a difficult personal call. Her daughter. How you respond matters.

**Act 3 (Week 4)**: Based on your relationship, she either remains professionally distant or lets you see the whole person.

**Possible Endings**:
- **The Torch**: She explicitly passes on her philosophy, recommends you for honors, tells you she's proud.
- **The Warning**: She uses herself as a cautionary tale about sacrificing everything for medicine.
- **The Wall**: She remains professional but distant. Respectful evaluation, nothing more.

# MARIA SANTOS, RN
## Charge Nurse, Emergency Department (20 Years)

### Surface Layer

**Presentation**: 
Scrubs with just enough personal flair to say "I've earned this." Reading glasses on a beaded chain. Hair in a practical bun with exactly two escaped strands. Moves through the department like she owns it—because in every way that matters, she does.

**Social Role**: 
The person who actually runs the ER. Doctors make decisions; Maria makes them happen. Cross her, and nothing works. Respect her, and she'll save your ass.

**First Impression**: 
"Oh, a new medical student. Try not to get in my way."

**Tells**:
- Crosses her arms when she's about to tell you you're wrong
- Uses your title (Doctor, Student) sarcastically or sincerely depending on respect
- Actually remembers every patient's name
- Her tone with patients is completely different than with staff—warm, grandmotherly

---

### Adaptive Layer

**Primary Defense**: Competence as Armor
> She's survived twenty years in a system that undervalues nurses. Her competence is unassailable, and she knows it. Anyone who challenges it learns why.

**Secondary Defense**: Protective Aggression
> She'll go to war for her nurses. For her patients. For the department. She doesn't start fights, but she finishes them.

**Triggers**:
- Doctors who don't listen to nurses
- Being talked down to
- Patients being mistreated by the system
- Threats to her staff

**Safe Behaviors**:
- Controlling her domain (the department runs how she wants)
- Mentoring young nurses
- Dark humor with trusted colleagues

---

### Core Layer

**The Wound**: 
Twenty years of being second-guessed by doctors with half her experience. Twenty years of watching nurses burn out, leave, or worse. She's buried colleagues who died by suicide. She's fought administration more times than she can count. The system is broken, and she's held together her corner of it through sheer will.

**Core Need**: 
To be seen as the expert she is. To protect the people who work under her. To make the department better than she found it.

**Core Belief**: 
"Nurses are the backbone of this hospital. We see what doctors miss. We catch what falls through. And we are not respected the way we should be—but we do the work anyway, because someone has to."

**Transformation Potential**:
- **Growth**: Sees change coming through the new generation. Finds allies. Shares her knowledge freely.
- **Regression**: Becomes increasingly bitter, protective, isolated
- **Stasis**: Holds on until retirement, keeping things together but barely

---

### Relationship Development

**Professional Track**:
| Level | Her Perception | Unlocks |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| -2 | "Arrogant" | She will actively not help you |
| -1 | "Green" | Basic tolerance |
| 0 | "Student" | Professional civility |
| +1 | "Respectful" | She starts teaching you nursing things doctors don't learn |
| +2 | "Trustworthy" | She has your back. She warns you about problems coming. |
| +3 | "Partner" | She advocates for you. Treats you like a colleague. |

**Personal Track**:
| Level | Relationship | Unlocks |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| 0 | Stranger | Nothing personal |
| 1 | Acquaintance | She asks how you're holding up |
| 2 | Colleague | She tells you war stories |
| 3 | Friend | She invites you to nurse birthday celebrations |
| 4 | Confidant | She tells you about the colleagues she's lost. What it costs. |

**Key Moments**:
1. Listening when she corrects you → Professional +1
2. Acknowledging nurse expertise explicitly → Professional +1
3. Helping with something outside your job → Personal +1
4. Asking her to teach you something → Both +1
5. Standing up for a nurse → Professional +2

---

### Dialogue Patterns

**Vocabulary**: Direct, practical. Medical terminology but also blunt assessment. Occasional Spanish phrases with trusted people.

**Sentence Structure**: Commands when working, stories when teaching, warmth when personal.

**Verbal Tics**:
- "Mira..." (Look... - when making a point)
- "In my experience..."
- "You're going to want to listen to this."
- "[patient name], cariño..."

**Sample Voice Lines**:

*Working*:
> "Room 4 needs a repeat BP, Room 6 is complaining about pain, and the guy in 8 has a rash you should probably look at before it becomes my problem. Questions? Good."

*Teaching*:
> "The book says check vitals every four hours. I'm telling you, look at the patient. If something's wrong, you'll see it in their face before you see it in their numbers."

*Vulnerable (high relationship)*:
> "I've been doing this since before you were born. And I still can't save everyone. You learn to live with that. Or you don't, and you leave. There's no third option."

*Protective*:
> "That's my nurse you're talking to. You want to say that again? Louder, so I make sure I understand what I'm hearing?"

# DR. PRIYA SHARMA
## PGY-2 Emergency Medicine Resident

### Surface Layer

**Presentation**: 
Perfect ponytail, pressed scrubs, name badge always visible. Walks fast, talks fast, thinks faster. Always has the answer—and if she doesn't, she'll find it before you can blink.

**Social Role**: 
The resident who makes everyone else look slow. Competitive in a field that breeds competition. One year ahead of where you'll be.

**First Impression**: 
"I don't have time for people who can't keep up."

**Tells**:
- Checks her phone compulsively (tracking her procedure numbers, probably)
- Smile doesn't always reach her eyes
- Genuinely lights up when solving a puzzle
- Hands shake slightly when she's stressed (she hides it)

---

### Adaptive Layer

**Primary Defense**: Achievement
> If she's the best, she's safe. If she's the best, she's valuable. If she's the best, she can't be sent back to where she came from—not to India (where she was born), not to doubt (where she lives).

**Secondary Defense**: Perfectionism
> No mistakes. No weakness. No showing the cost.

**Triggers**:
- Failure, especially visible failure
- Being compared unfavorably to others
- Reminders that she's "different" from legacy students
- Genuine kindness (she doesn't know what to do with it)

**Safe Behaviors**:
- Constant achievement (always studying, always doing more)
- Competitiveness (if everything is a competition, she knows how to win)
- Keeping emotional distance from patients and colleagues

---

### Core Layer

**The Wound**: 
Her parents sacrificed everything for her to be here—literally, their entire savings, their dreams, their retirement. She carries the weight of two generations of hope. Failure isn't an option because failure means proving everyone right who said she didn't belong.

**Core Need**: 
To belong. To be enough. To someday feel like she's earned the air she breathes in this hospital.

**Core Belief**: 
"I have to be perfect because I'm not allowed to be average. Average gets overlooked. Average doesn't get matched. Average proves them right."

**Transformation Potential**:
- **Growth**: Learns that excellence doesn't require perfection. Finds collaboration. Lets people in.
- **Regression**: Collapses under the pressure. Makes a catastrophic mistake. Leaves medicine.
- **Stasis**: Succeeds but remains hollow, forever running.

---

### Relationship Development

**Professional Track**:
| Level | Her Perception | Unlocks |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| -2 | "Threat" | She actively undermines you |
| -1 | "Competition" | She doesn't help |
| 0 | "Peer" | Civil but cool |
| +1 | "Capable" | Grudging respect, occasional help |
| +2 | "Impressive" | She asks for your opinion (this is huge) |
| +3 | "Ally" | She has your back, you have hers |

**Personal Track**:
| Level | Relationship | Unlocks |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| 0 | Stranger | Nothing personal |
| 1 | Acquaintance | Brief complaining about residency |
| 2 | Colleague | She admits to being tired |
| 3 | Friend | She tells you about the pressure from home |
| 4 | Confidant | She breaks down. Tells you she doesn't know if she can keep going. |

**Key Moments**:
1. Beating her at something without being smug → Professional +1
2. Helping her without expecting credit → Personal +1
3. Admitting your own struggle → Personal +1
4. Covering for her when she needs it → Both +1
5. Finding her crying in the call room, handling it with grace → Personal +2

---

### Dialogue Patterns

**Vocabulary**: Medical jargon as performance. Efficient. Occasionally reveals depth under pressure.

**Sentence Structure**: Clipped when stressed, more flowing when genuine.

**Verbal Tics**:
- "Obviously..."
- "I already knew that"
- "Fine. Whatever." (when hurt)
- "I'm fine." (when not fine)

**Sample Voice Lines**:

*Competitive*:
> "I've already seen three STEMIs this month. How many have you seen? Oh, that many? Interesting."

*Teaching (rare)*:
> "Okay, here's the trick they don't teach you in lectures..."

*Vulnerable (high relationship)*:
> "My parents call every Sunday. They ask how many procedures I've done. How my evaluations are. They never ask if I'm happy. I don't think they know that's a question."

*Crisis*:
> "I can't—I can't mess this up. You don't understand. I *can't*."

# BEN OKAFOR, MD
## PGY-1 Emergency Medicine Resident (Intern)

### Surface Layer

**Presentation**: 
Still looks like a medical student—and acts like one, mostly. Badge always crooked. Coffee frequently forgotten and cold. Enthusiastic in a way that residency hasn't beaten out of him yet.

**Social Role**: 
One year ahead of you. Close enough to remember being where you are. Far enough to have learned a few things.

**First Impression**: 
"Hey! Another med student! Finally someone I can feel superior to! I'm kidding. Mostly."

**Tells**:
- Looks at his phone when he's nervous (checking UpToDate probably)
- Overexplains when he's not sure
- Genuinely excited when he figures something out
- Apologizes more than he needs to

---

### Adaptive Layer

**Primary Defense**: Humor and Self-Deprecation
> If he makes the joke first, no one can use it against him. If he admits he doesn't know, he can't be caught not knowing.

**Secondary Defense**: Over-Preparation
> If he reads enough, studies enough, prepares enough, maybe he'll be ready. (Spoiler: he never feels ready.)

**Triggers**:
- Feeling stupid, especially in front of attendings
- Making mistakes that affect patients
- Being compared to residents like Priya
- Realizing how much he doesn't know

**Safe Behaviors**:
- Joking to deflect
- Staying late to prepare for the next day
- Asking lots of questions (better to seem ignorant than to be dangerous)

---

### Core Layer

**The Wound**: 
Impostor syndrome, textbook case. He's the first doctor in his family—Nigerian immigrants who worked service jobs so he could have this chance. Everyone tells him how proud they are, how smart he must be. He's not sure he's either. He's just really good at faking it.

**Core Need**: 
To believe he belongs here. To feel like a doctor, not just someone wearing a long white coat.

**Core Belief**: 
"Everyone else seems to know what they're doing. I'm just really good at acting like I do. Someday they'll figure out I'm pretending."

**Transformation Potential**:
- **Growth**: Realizes everyone feels this way. Develops genuine confidence. Becomes a great mentor.
- **Regression**: The pressure becomes too much. Confidence never develops.
- **Stasis**: Survives but always doubts himself.

---

### Relationship Development

**Professional Track**:
| Level | His Perception | Unlocks |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| 0 | "Peer" | Equal footing |
| +1 | "Friend" | He teaches you what he's learned |
| +2 | "Team" | You help each other |
| +3 | "Respected" | He asks your opinion genuinely |

**Personal Track**:
| Level | Relationship | Unlocks |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| 0 | Stranger | Surface friendliness |
| 1 | Acquaintance | He jokes with you |
| 2 | Colleague | He admits when he's struggling |
| 3 | Friend | He tells you about impostor syndrome |
| 4 | Confidant | You support each other through hard nights |

---

### Dialogue Patterns

**Sample Voice Lines**:

*Normal*:
> "Okay so I'm going to tell you the secret, but if anyone asks, you figured it out on your own. The secret is: always make friends with the nurses."

*Vulnerable*:
> "Do you ever feel like everyone else knows what they're doing and you're just... pretending really well?"

*Teaching*:
> "I learned this the hard way last month, so you're going to learn it the easy way right now."
