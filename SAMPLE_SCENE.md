# SAMPLE SCENE: First Shift, First Patient

*This demonstrates gameplay mechanics, skill checks, internal dialogue, and the educational integration.*

---

## SHIFT START

**6:47 AM — County General Emergency Department**

The fluorescent lights are unforgiving. You've been here since 6 AM for orientation, but the shift doesn't officially start until 7. Dr. Reyes—Jimmy, he said to call him Jimmy, but that feels presumptuous—is walking you through the department.

**JIMMY**: Trauma bays are there. Don't go in unless someone tells you to. Minor care is over there—that's where you'll probably live for the first few days. The board is here.

He gestures at a whiteboard covered in names, room numbers, and cryptic abbreviations.

**JIMMY**: This is where you'll know who's here, who's waiting, and who's about to ruin your day. Any questions?

**[DIALOGUE OPTIONS]:**

→ **"Where's the coffee?"** (TEAMWORK +1 with Jimmy — humor is welcome)

→ **"What should I focus on learning first?"** (Opens teaching dialogue)

→ **"I'm ready. What do you need me to do?"** (HIERARCHY appropriate, slightly eager)

→ *Stay quiet and observe* (COMPOSURE check DC 6 — nervous silence)

---

**[IF: "What should I focus on learning first?"]**

**JIMMY**: [slight pause, reassessing you]

Huh. Okay. Most students ask where to hide.

He leans against the nurses' station.

**JIMMY**: Here's the truth. You're going to feel useless for at least a week. That's normal. Don't try to be a hero. Don't try to prove yourself. Just do three things:

**MEMORY** (internal): *Listen. He's telling you how to survive.*

**JIMMY**: One—take good histories. Patients tell you what's wrong with them if you let them talk. Two—know your vitals. If someone's heart rate is 130 and you don't notice, that's on you. Three—ask questions. I'd rather explain something twice than watch you hurt someone because you were too proud to ask.

**[LESSON UNLOCKED: "The Three Things"]**
*+1 to HISTORY checks when you've spent at least 2 minutes with a patient*
*DOUBT will remind you to check vital signs*

**JIMMY**: Now. Ready to see your first patient?

## FIRST PATIENT: THE CHEST PAIN

**Room 4 — Chief Complaint: Chest Pain**

The chart on the door says:

```
MARTINEZ, ELENA — 52 F
CC: Chest pain × 2 hours
Vitals: BP 142/88, HR 96, RR 18, O2 98% RA, Temp 98.6°F
Allergies: PCN
```

**MEMORY**: *Chest pain. The big one. Could be nothing—could be a heart attack. What was the mnemonic? OLDCARTS? OPQRST?*

**DOUBT**: *You're going to mess this up.*

**COMPOSURE**: *Breathe. You've practiced this. Go.*

You knock on the door and enter.

Mrs. Martinez is sitting on the stretcher in a hospital gown, arms crossed, looking annoyed. A younger woman—her daughter, maybe—sits in the corner, scrolling through her phone.

**MRS. MARTINEZ**: Finally. I've been waiting forty-five minutes.

---

### THE HISTORY

**[DIALOGUE OPTIONS — Opening]:**

→ **"I'm sorry for the wait. I'm Alex, a medical student working with the team today. Can you tell me what brought you in?"** 
   (COMMUNICATION DC 6 — standard introduction)

→ **"Mrs. Martinez, I understand you're having chest pain. Can you describe it for me?"**
   (HISTORY DC 6 — direct approach)

→ **"Before we talk about your symptoms, how are you feeling right now?"**
   (EMPATHY DC 8 — emotional check-in first)

→ *Freeze. Stand there. Say nothing.*
   (COMPOSURE DC 8 to recover, failure = awkward silence)

---

**[IF: Standard introduction — COMMUNICATION SUCCESS]**

**MRS. MARTINEZ**: [softening slightly] A student. Great. Is there an actual doctor coming, or...?

**BEDSIDE**: *She's not being mean. She's scared. People get sharp when they're scared.*

**DAUGHTER**: [looking up] Mom. Be nice.

**MRS. MARTINEZ**: [sighing] Fine. It's probably nothing. I've just had this... pressure. Here.

She puts her hand flat on her chest, center of her sternum.

**MEMORY**: *Pressure. Not "pain." That's cardiac language. Women often describe it differently.*

---

### TAKING THE HISTORY

**[SKILL CHECK: HISTORY DC 8]**
*What questions do you ask?*

**[CHOOSE THREE QUESTIONS — more can be asked, but time passes]:**

**□ "When did this start?"** (ONSET)
**□ "What does it feel like—sharp, dull, pressure?"** (QUALITY)
**□ "Does it go anywhere—your arm, your jaw, your back?"** (RADIATION)
**□ "How bad is it on a scale of 1-10?"** (SEVERITY)
**□ "Does anything make it better or worse?"** (MODIFYING)
**□ "Have you had anything like this before?"** (CONTEXT)
**□ "Any other symptoms—nausea, sweating, shortness of breath?"** (ASSOCIATED)
**□ "What were you doing when it started?"** (TEMPORAL)
**□ "Do you have any heart problems, diabetes, high blood pressure?"** (PMH)
**□ "Does heart disease run in your family?"** (FAMILY HX)

---

**[RESPONSES — Based on questions asked]:**

**"When did this start?"**
> About two hours ago. I was making breakfast, and it just... started.

**"What does it feel like?"**
> It's not really pain, exactly. More like... someone's sitting on my chest. Pressure.

**"Does it go anywhere else?"**
> [hesitates] My jaw, maybe? I thought it was a toothache at first.

**INSTINCT**: *Jaw pain. That's a red flag. Pay attention.*

**"How bad is it?"**
> I don't know, maybe a 4? It's not that bad. I'm probably wasting your time.

**"Anything make it better or worse?"**
> Not really. Tums didn't help.

**"Any other symptoms?"**
> I've been a little sweaty. But it's hot in here.

**DOUBT**: *It's not that hot in here.*

**"Any heart problems, diabetes?"**
> I have type 2 diabetes. And high blood pressure, but I take medication for that.

**MEMORY**: *Diabetes. Diabetics have atypical presentations. They can have silent MIs. This is not nothing.*

**"Family history?"**
> My father had a heart attack at 55.

**INSTINCT**: *This woman is having a heart attack. Do something.*

**COMPOSURE**: *Don't panic. You're a student. Go get the resident.*

---

### THE DECISION POINT

**[BOARD UPDATE]:**

```
SYMPTOMS PINNED:
🔴 Chest pressure (atypical description)
🔴 Jaw pain (radiation)
🔴 Diaphoresis (sweating)
🔴 Tums ineffective

RISK FACTORS:
🔴 52 F, postmenopausal
🔴 Diabetes
🔴 Hypertension
🔴 Family history (father MI at 55)

DIFFERENTIAL:
📋 Acute Coronary Syndrome (HIGH suspicion)
📋 GERD/Esophageal spasm
📋 Musculoskeletal
📋 Anxiety/Panic attack
```

**HUMANITY**: *She's scared. Look at her hands—she's gripping the rail.*

**COMPOSURE**: *You need to go get Jimmy. Now. But you can't scare her.*

---

**[DIALOGUE OPTIONS — Transitioning]:**

→ **"Mrs. Martinez, I want to get my supervising resident to take a look at you. I'll be right back."**
   (COMMUNICATION DC 6 — appropriate and professional)

→ **"I'm going to order an EKG right now. Don't move."**
   (HIERARCHY DC 10 — overstepping, but correct medically)

→ **"I think you might be having a heart attack."**
   (COMMUNICATION FAILURE — panic-inducing, not your call to make)

→ **"It's probably just heartburn. Try to relax."**
   (TERRIBLE CHOICE — ignoring red flags)

---

**[IF: Getting the resident — SUCCESS]**

You step out of the room, heart pounding.

**COMPOSURE**: *Walk. Don't run. Don't scare the patient. Don't scare yourself.*

Jimmy is at the nurses' station, typing.

**YOU**: Dr. Reyes? I have a 52-year-old woman in Room 4, chest pressure for two hours, radiating to her jaw, diaphoretic, diabetic, hypertensive, family history of early MI. I'm worried about ACS.

**[SKILL CHECK: DIFFERENTIAL DC 10]**
*Did you present the case correctly?*

---

**[SUCCESS — DC 10]**

Jimmy looks up. His expression changes.

**JIMMY**: Okay. Good pickup. Let's go.

He's already moving. You follow.

**JIMMY**: [over his shoulder] Did you get an EKG?

**YOU**: No, I—

**JIMMY**: [to the nurses' station] Maria, I need an EKG in Room 4, stat. And put her on a monitor.

**MARIA**: On it.

**JIMMY**: [to you] You did the right thing. You got me. Now watch.

**LESSON UNLOCKED: "Know Your Limits"**
*Asking for help when appropriate builds trust rather than damaging it*
*+1 to HIERARCHY checks when escalating appropriately*

---

### THE EKG

The tech wheels in the EKG machine. Mrs. Martinez looks more worried now—she can tell something has changed.

**MRS. MARTINEZ**: What's going on? Is it serious?

**JIMMY**: We're going to find out. This won't hurt at all.

The EKG prints. Jimmy looks at it. His jaw tightens.

**JIMMY**: [quietly, to you] Come here. What do you see?

He hands you the strip.

```
[EKG IMAGE WOULD APPEAR HERE]
12-lead EKG showing:
- Regular rhythm, rate 98
- ST elevations in leads II, III, aVF
- Reciprocal ST depressions in I, aVL
```

**[SKILL CHECK: INTERPRETATION DC 12]**
*What does this EKG show?*

**[OPTIONS]:**

→ **"ST elevations in the inferior leads. This is a STEMI."**
   (CORRECT — you recognize the pattern)

→ **"The rhythm looks regular. I'm not sure what else I'm seeing."**
   (PARTIAL — honest about limitations)

→ **"I think I see something wrong, but I don't know what it means."**
   (HONEST — you're learning)

→ **"It looks normal to me."**
   (INCORRECT — you missed critical findings)

---

**[IF: Correct identification — "ST elevations in the inferior leads"]**

**JIMMY**: [looks at you differently] Yeah. It is.

He turns to Maria.

**JIMMY**: Call a STEMI alert. Get cardiology on the line. I need aspirin, heparin, and let's get a second IV.

The room transforms. Suddenly there are three nurses, another tech, someone paging overhead. Mrs. Martinez is crying. Her daughter is standing up, phone forgotten.

**DAUGHTER**: What's happening? What's a STEMI?

**EMPATHY**: *She needs someone to explain. Everyone else is busy.*

**COMPOSURE**: *You are the only person available to talk to this family right now.*

---

**[DIALOGUE OPTIONS — Family Communication]:**

→ **"Your mother is having a heart attack. The team is going to take her for a procedure to open the blocked artery. This is serious, but we caught it early."**
   (COMMUNICATION DC 10 — clear, honest, appropriate)

→ **"The doctors are taking care of her. You should wait in the waiting room."**
   (AVOIDANT — technically okay but unhelpful)

→ **"I'm a student, I can't really explain—"**
   (HONEST but abandoning the family)

→ *Try to explain but get overwhelmed*
   (COMPOSURE DC 10 or failure)

---

**[IF: Clear family communication — SUCCESS]**

The daughter grabs your arm.

**DAUGHTER**: Thank you. Thank you for explaining. [voice breaking] Is she going to be okay?

**HUMANITY**: *You don't know. You genuinely don't know. But she needs something.*

**HONESTY** (new voice): *Don't promise what you can't deliver.*

**YOU**: The team is very good, and we caught this early. That matters. They're going to take her to the cath lab now—a specialist will open the artery. I'll come find you when there's news. Is there someone you should call?

**DAUGHTER**: [nodding] My brother. I'll call my brother.

**EMPATHY**: *She has someone. Good.*

---

### AFTERMATH

Mrs. Martinez is wheeled out. The room is suddenly quiet.

Jimmy finds you standing there, still holding the EKG.

**JIMMY**: Hey.

You look up.

**JIMMY**: That was good. The way you presented, the way you talked to the family. That was good work.

**YOU**: I didn't do anything. I just... told you.

**JIMMY**: [half-smile] Yeah. That's the job. Recognize trouble, get help, don't make it worse. You'd be surprised how many people can't do that.

He takes the EKG from your hand.

**JIMMY**: She's probably going to be fine, by the way. Inferior STEMIs have better prognosis than anterior. And you caught it early. That matters.

**[RELATIONSHIP UPDATE]:**
*Jimmy Reyes — Professional: +1 (Appropriate escalation)*
*Jimmy Reyes — Personal: +1 (Handled stress well)*

**[XP GAINED]:**
- Correct differential identification: +15 XP
- Appropriate escalation: +10 XP
- Family communication: +10 XP
- First STEMI recognition: +25 XP (MILESTONE)

**[LESSON UNLOCKED: "Inferior STEMI Pattern"]**
*ST elevations in II, III, aVF with reciprocal changes in I, aVL*
*+2 to future INTERPRETATION checks involving inferior STEMIs*

---

**JIMMY**: Okay. You've got two more hours on your shift. There's a guy in Room 7 with a cough. Think you can handle a cough?

**DOUBT**: *Can you?*

**COMPOSURE**: *You just helped catch a heart attack. You can handle a cough.*

**YOU**: Let me grab the chart.

**JIMMY**: That's what I like to hear.

## DESIGN NOTES

This scene demonstrates:

1. **Educational integration** — Medical terminology introduced contextually, defined through gameplay
2. **Skill check variety** — COMMUNICATION, HISTORY, INTERPRETATION, COMPOSURE all tested
3. **Internal dialogue** — Multiple "skill voices" commenting, conflicting, guiding
4. **Meaningful choices** — Different paths based on player decisions
5. **Consequence system** — Correct identification leads to positive outcomes and lessons
6. **Relationship building** — Jimmy's opinion changes based on performance
7. **Emotional beats** — The family communication adds humanity to the medical scenario
8. **Learning through play** — The STEMI pattern is now permanently in the player's toolkit

**Alternate paths not shown:**
- Missing the diagnosis → patient deteriorates, discovered later, LESSON still learned but with guilt
- Overstepping to order EKG yourself → might work, but HIERARCHY conflict with nursing
- Failing to communicate with family → emotional consequences, reputation damage
- Completely freezing → Jimmy notices, gentle redirection, lower starting reputation
